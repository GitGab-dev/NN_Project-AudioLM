## How to install in local

We suggests using Colab, but the code had been tested in local with a Python 3.10 environment. You can clone the repository and install the requirements.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/GitGab-dev/NN_Project-AudioLM
  cd NN_Project-AudioLM
  pip install -r requirements
```
